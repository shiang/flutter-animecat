## About the app

- This app is created with Flutter with StatefulWidget and Animation library classes

## This app covers the following concepts from flutter:

- Intro to the **Animation**, **AnimationController**, and **Tween** classes
- Animation Class: To record the current _value_ of the property being animated. Also records the status of the animation (running or stopped ..etc)
- AnimationController Class: Control the animation status (forward, completed, reverse...etc)
- Tween Class: describe the range that the value being animated spans
- Intro to **AnimatedBuilder**: Takes an animation and a _builder_ function. Everytime the animation value changes, builder reruns
- Intro to the StatefulWidget lifecycle method _initState_
- Intro to the **TickerProviderStateMixin** for a StatefulWidget to properly start animation
- Intro to the **GestureDetector** and **Stack** Widget
- Intro to the **StatusListener** on Animation class to change the animation status based on the events received
